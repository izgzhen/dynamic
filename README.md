# Dynamic

This is an experimental hack for building a static analyzer for a
subset of JavaScript language.

## Current Status

+ Coarse lattice + Concrete modeling
+ k-CFA
+ Deterministic + Top-level driving

## Language
+ [x] Closure
+ [x] Dynamic accessing
+ [x] Imperative control
+ [x] Object

## TODOs
- [ ] Componentize the code base
- [ ] Refine the `APrim` lattice
- [ ] Path sensitivity
- [ ] Introduce exception flows
